Consumer Insights &amp; Analytics Internship,  there is an additional project/assignment as a part of the application process.   Attached is sample data for that assignment.  Using this data, please prepare a  one-page analysis/report on the Team USA Summer Champions Series ñ Track &amp; Field  Championships.  You may format it as either a PowerPoint slide or an 8.5x11 printed sheet  (single sided).

You may use any tools you have at your disposal to work with the data.
