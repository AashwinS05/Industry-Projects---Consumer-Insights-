## Attached is the sample data for the assignment and my solution as a PDF.

## Approach
I took a 2 prolonged approach to reach to the solution and provide insights -

1. Descriptive Analytics: Just analyzed the data to excavate hidden insights
2. Sentiment Analysis: Analyzed the tweets and fb posts to decipher the content and find those words within the tweets that attaracted the most attention and thus should be used more often for future campaigns.
